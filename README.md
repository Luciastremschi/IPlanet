An amazing site which provides you with knowledge about the universe, planets, stars...This project is your ticket to an awesome adventure through the galaxy ()

1. I created a Figma design of the landing page

2. Added index.html and liked the style.css to it

3. Created the header and the main of the landing page using FlexBox mostly

4. Added a form with two buttons (start & watch video)

5. Created a neu file mainpage.html which is linked to the Start button (this is where things get interesting)

6. (needs a lot of work and improvement the navigation bar)
